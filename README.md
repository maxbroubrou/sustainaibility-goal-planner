# Sustainability Goal Planner

This project is a sustainability goal planner application built using Ruby on Rails with React webpacker setup. The application allows to follow goal progresses over time.

It could actually be used for any kind of goal planning but there is a special focus of goals with a specific unit of measurement (e.g. kg EqCo2, mÂ², etc.) and a target value to reach.
